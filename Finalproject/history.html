        <H1>A long time ago..</H1>
        
        <p class="history"> My love for the mysterious, whimsical and magical world began at the tender age of six years old. On a cool Autumn night, my mother took me on an adventure. We went house to house in our neighborhood. The neighborhood had been transformed into <span class="span">nightmarish scene</span>.  </p>

        <p class="history"> There were people were everywhere, dressed as a spectacular array of characters. My little heart was pounding, and I was smiling from ear to ear.  Shortly, I had a bounty of sugary delights stored securely within my orange glowing pumpkin bucket. The crescendo of the evening happened on our return home.</p>
        <p class="history"> There was one final home to pass. This home was dark. There were no adornments in the yard.  Only a single sign was at the edge of the road. The sign said “Garage”. I looked down the dark driveway to see that garage door was up. I was scared. I looked at mother and said, “Let's go home”.  She smiled and pointed me toward my impending <span class="span"> doom</span>.</p>
        <p class="history"> As I approached, shapes began to form in the pitch-black void. A shadowy figure was sitting on a lawn chair. A wooden table was positioned next to this figure. On top of the table was a giant bowl full of large candy bars. I froze.  </p>
        <p class="history"> My stare was intense as studied this figure. It looked like a giant stuffed wolf. The wolf didn’t move.  I gazed upon the wolf for what seemed to be an eternity looking for any signs of movement. The wolf didn’t move. I took a step forward. The wolf didn’t move. I took three steps forward. The wolf didn’t move.</p>
        <p class="history"> I had now committed to the mission. Those candys were mine. I was determined. I threw my hands up in a final act bravery and scream at the wolf. The wolf didn’t move.</p>
        <p class="history"> I broke into a sprint toward the garage. My eyes were fixated on the bowl of candy. I reached forward to retrieve my reward as my feet crossed the threshold.  A burst of light erupted as I entered the garage. I stopped. The light was flashing so fast. I was disoriented. I turned my gaze from the candy to the wolf. The wolf moved.</p>
        <p class="history"> I was mesmerized, frightened, excited and delighted as I experienced my first Halloween.  The scene in the garage was the first time I had ever experienced a strobe light. I was in awe as my neighbor moved within the light looking like a real life stop animation werewolf. My fear left and pure joy came over me.  </p>
        <p class="history"> This event sparked my imagination. I have a passion for immersive experiences. Creating experiences should be a done in a way that leads to joy. Simple elements such as storytelling, pacing, setting and atmosphere lead users to become invested in discovering more. I enjoy creating stories and experiences. I am most happy when allowed to let my imagination run free. </p>
