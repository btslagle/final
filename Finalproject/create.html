        <p>My creativity comes in many forms. I enjoy writing, music, inventing and problems solving. I am most happy and alive when I am in creative flow. I want to demonstrate my creative process with a concept for a haunted house attraction that I have created called “Corridors”. My love for the mysterious, whimsical and spooky begain an early age.

                    First, I thought of a core concept. Fear comes in my forms. I chose the image of a closed door with light emanating from the cracks around the door. This image symbolizes a world of possibilities of what could be beyond the door.</p>
                    <p>A door is a barrier. A door can serve to keep someone out or to contain something within. A Corridor is long passage filled with doors and possibilities. Be careful which doors you chose to open.

            </div>
            <div class="text-col"> 
                <p>I decided that I wanted the layout of the attraction to be a reocurring set of corridors. I made a rough sketch to define the pathway around the haunt.</p>
                <p>I sectioned it into a staging area, themed rooms and mazes that would lead between the themed rooms. Upon entry, guests are greeted in the staging at the beginning of a long open hallway that ends in at a set of elevator doors. A long the wall of the hallway are numerous doors that lead to dead ends, frights and the entrance to the next themed section.
                </p>
                <p>
                This staging area is the key element to the attraction.  It will be recreated three times throughout the haunt. Everytime the guest finsh a themed area they walk into another exact copy of the stagging area as if they were first entering the attraction. This creates a feeling of a loop they can not escape.  </p>

            <div class="text-col">
            <p>Next, I created the themed sections of the attraction.  The purpose of the themed section is to show what happens when you chose to enter the wrong door.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The first theme was that of late 1800s hotel based upon the true story of H.H. Holmes. Holmes built hotel rooms in to traps that executed his victims.</p>
            
            <p>The second theme was a hospital theme based upon the true story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cullen" target="_blank">Charles Cullen</a> a nurse that murdered up to 40 of his patients.</p>

                        The final section of the haunt is a twisted reality escape from the attraction. This section of the haunt will incorporate illusions, obstacles, props and blacklight paint. The idea is to have a disorienting path and create a since of urgency to escape. </p>
                        
                        <p>The attraction ends back in the stagging area. The evelvator doors are open with an exit sign glowing inside. The final scene is a giant monster charging the guest from the elevator.   </p>
