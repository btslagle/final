            My name is <span class="span">Brad Slagle.</span> I started in the title room at FMCC. I went on to Credit
            Reanalysis where I became a subject matter expert for the Transfer and Rewrite processes. I was a lead
            trainer for the transitionary period when the processes moved to FCGBC. I assisted with process maps, work
            assignments, instruction and auditing completed work.

                I am a problem solver.
            </span>
            I want to be a Software Developer so that I will have the tools to design, display and demonstrate
            solutions. I want to create new amazing products and experiences to delight and amaze customers. I look for
            ways to improve, processes, procedures and find solutions to streamline our services.

            I pitched an idea for a macro to guard private information that was a solution to a common problem
            when mailing form letters. The idea was accepted, embraced and created immediately. This macro is now used
            throughout the company. I know that I can find many more opportunities for improvement. </p>
